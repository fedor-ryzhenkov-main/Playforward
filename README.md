# A Playforward WEB —— A simple music player for TTRPGs

## Features
- Local storage for uploading and storing audio tracks
- Audio playback using Howler.js
- Playlists, descriptions and tags for categorising your tracks.
- Multi-track playback with looping and crossfade.

## In the next patch:

- General visual improvements: buttons, fonts, and all those little details.
- Replacing the default browser input interface with a custom one (it's already written, just needs to be connected).
- Shortcuts for everything to allow full use without a mouse.
- Playlist descriptions and the ability to launch all tracks from a playlist at once.
- Volume normalization to ensure the volume sliders behave predictably.
- Export/import of the library in a unified format so it can be transferred to another browser or shared with friends.

## What not to expect (unless I get a lot of free time or more people join the team):

- Proper mobile device support.
- Proper support for non-Chromium browsers.
